  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>I am a software developer/"technical guy".  Most of my development experience is in Java and JavaScript, though I try not to pidgeonhole myself too much in what I will be working on next.  Over the years I've worked on a number of fairly random projects in a number of fairly random technologies: a space system written in <a href="http://community.pennmush.org/book/export/html/536">MUSHCode</a>, a charter school lottery in ColdFusion, and a <a href="https://github.com/tildedave/apep-chess-engine">chess engine</a> in C++.</p>

  <p>I believe strongly in creating an active environment where engineers are able to do the "right things" that enable faster delivery of better software.  My programming values align pretty closely with XP and I think that, as technical people, we need to always keep the customer in mind in what we are building and designing and what problems we solve or end up ignoring.</p>

  <p>I've been doing development out of the Rackspace office in Blacksburg, VA building web applications since September 2009.  Before that, in <a href="/academics.html">another life</a>, I was a PhD student at Penn State studying security-enforcing compilers in the <a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/">Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security</a> laboratory.</p>

  <p>This blog is currently built using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, deployed with <a href="www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, and hosted on the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.
