      <h2>Functional Programming and the Web</h2>

      I talk about why functional languages are a good tool for any
      programmer to add to their toolkit, specifically using Clojure for
      rapid prototyping of support tools on a modern web project.

      I've given two versions of this talk: one on April 28, 2011 on the
      Virginia Tech campus, an audience of mostly students, and one on June
      16, 2011 for the Software Developers Forum, an audience of mostly
      other software professionals.

      <h3>Abstract</h3>

      <p>Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes
        operations over datatypes.  Languages such as Haskell, Lisp, and ML
        have used in academics for years, but recently new languages such as
        Scala, Erlang, and Clojure have emerged for handling the challenges of
        high-scalability systems.  We will show how functional languages
        enable rapid prototyping of tools, with our guiding example being an
        internal application, written in the JVM language Clojure, to assist
        software development at Rackspace.
