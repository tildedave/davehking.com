# About Me

Software nut before it was cool, and lifelong nerd.  From New Jersey by way of a bunch of smaller college towns.  It's a good life, but I sometimes miss the mountains.

> "Behind this thought there was a worse one, with which he dared not not grapple.  Perhaps man was neither good nor bad, was only a machine in an insensate universe--his courage no more than a reflex to danger, like the automatic jump at the pin-prick. Perhaps there were no virtues, unless jumping at pin-pricks was a virtue, and humanity only a mechanical donkey led on by the iron carrot of love, through the pointless treadmill of reproduction.  Perhaps Might was a law of Nature, needed to keep the survivors fit.  Perhaps he himself..." - TH White
