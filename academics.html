  <h1>My Time in the Academy</h1>

  <p>I was a graduate student at Penn State University from Fall 2003 to
    Summer 2009.  During that time I had many opportunities to collaborate
    with some very smart people on topics that I cared passionately
    about. My advisor was <a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~tjaeger">Trent
      Jaeger</a>.</p>

  <p>I defended my thesis ("Retrofitting Programs for Complete Security
    Mediation") in August 2009.</p>

  <p>Graduate school is an interesting career path and in Computer
  Science we are lucky to be able to follow our passions and still
  land with decent career prospects.  If you are interested in doing
  research as a career or in working on self-directed projects, I
  definitely recommend graduate school.</p>

  <p>In graduate school, you will be exposed to brilliant people,
  great ideas, and gain skills that ultimately translate well into
  real world experience. (That said, it was an incredibly difficult
  and stressful experience I am happy to have in my rear-view.)</p>
